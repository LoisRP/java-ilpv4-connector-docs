* **Link** A connection between two peers, involving a single account, where ILPv4 packets can be exchanged over some network transport \(such as a Websocket or a regular HTTP connection\). 
* **Peer** Any entity that has agreed to exchange Interledger packets with another entity. This sometimes refers to two individuals who share an account. However, this can also refer to software programs that are connected to each other in a peering relationship. See **Peer Node** for more details. 
* **Peer Node** An Interledger sender, router, or receiver that has an accounting relationship with another server.
